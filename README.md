## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Creating the settings screen and getting it to store the default values was difficult to configure in Swift 4, as the code on the CodePath website was outdated. There were some resources that allowed me to get the syntax right, but with the deadline looming I wasn't able to get it working in time.
